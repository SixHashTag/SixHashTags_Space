		<h1><center>Destined to fall, but can WE change?</center></h1>
			Economic crisis getting more worse
			Stolk prices rising sky high
			Never ending problems in a bloody nation
			A nation that's built to die

			From peace to war and war to peace
			This cycle just never ends
			Unless someone comes and breaks the cycle
			and stand their ground till the end
			
			Even though they say we got our freedom
			in 1948
			We're still under the rule of greater people
			Because it is our fate
			
			And though they say that fate can change
			I doubt that this one can
			Because the people of this country will never change
			It's a curse upon our land
			
			No matter if you're here to help
			And even if you're not
			The people will cry "What a freak!"
			And leave you there to rot
			
			The government won't fix this economic crisis
			They're just waiting for people to donate
			When they can help with this problem, they just stand there
			Ignoring our complaints
			
			This nations pride is hanging by a rope
			And just one single wrong step
			We'll slip and fall to the abyss of the forgotten
			And we'll be stuck there with nothing but regret
			
			This country had always been in danger
			It's something that can't be changed
			It's the fate of our people, we're destined to fall
			But can WE change?
			
			"Yes we can!" I think you might say
			And I agree with you too
			Because this country desperately needs it
			And what harm does a little change do?
			
			But trust me, millions have tried to change them
			But nothing has ever worked
			Because they always believe that those people were wrong
			And say that "Tradition comes first"
			
			And most of the time they don't care what other people say
			THeir opinions don't matter to them
			If their leaders and elders say it's wrong without a second thought
			They would ignore the opinions you have
			
			And worst of all is that they can manipulate
			the country's young youth
			Telling them to only follow their traditions
			Even if it's not the truth
			
			And I'm sorry if what I'm saying bothers you
			I just wanted to tell my opinion too
			But even if what I have said is mean
			Isn't it kind of true?
			
			And I know you're thinking, even though I've said all of this,
			Aren't I a Sri Lankan too?
			But I never once said that  liked this country
			Nor the people that live there too
			
			Unless the people of this country decide to change
			all their ways or at least try
			My hatred for this forever will live
			Until the day I die
			
			But if you ever hear them beg and cry for help
			Please don't look back
			This country deserves the torture, it was never meant to be
			It was never meant to last
